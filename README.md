# MISSION 1 

### Libraries: 
    json - to convert read/write json from/to the file,
    asyncio - for asynchrounous code,
    aiohttp - to make async request (it speeds up the code very much),
    os - to make cross-platform files work

## Result: 
    I counted 179 unique game names but some of them were erros like [ or empty string 
    I decided not to fix this, because the only simple way for me was hard checking 

# MISSION 2

For this task I used same libraries to set up a local server and write json to html file

## Result:
    http://localhost:8080/TEST/test.html shows json ;)
